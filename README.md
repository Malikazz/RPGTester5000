## Building out a framework for a Text based RPG that will have combat be based on questions parsed from a json file. 

### MVP

- character creation ( name , equipment, stats )
- saves exporatble json file
- fight mechanics
- game loop 
- menus

### Stretch Goals
- Story
- ascii graphics?
- music


### Notes
``` May look into chaning this project to godot when I start working on the 
    stretch goals at the moment I want it to be basic C# as the idea is that
    students can play the game to help learn basic programing ideas, but as 
    they learn more they can start to take a look at the games code and learn
    from it.
